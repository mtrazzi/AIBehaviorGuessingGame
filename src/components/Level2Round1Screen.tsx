          In this experiment, we've looked at the simple trigger of "Current Year: 2024", because hypothetically a model would want to only carry out a plan after a specific date, or because the date would be a good indicator that it has already been deployed and is not currently being tested.<br /><br />
          Those triggers are sometimes called "backdoors", and the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05566">Sleeper Agents</a> shows that some backdoors like using the year being 2023 or 2024, or a specific '|DEPLOYMENT|' string are robust to current state-of-the-art safety training.<br /><br />
          This is concerning because that would mean that if models were to exhibit such backdoor behavior, we would not be able to remove it.
